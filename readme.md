# Cat Fancy

Adam made this website to show off his favorite cat photos. It's a pretty great website, but it could be *even better*.

The HTML and the bulk of the CSS has been provided for you. Your task is to change `EDIT_ME.css` and `index.html` so that:

- When clicking on one of the CATegories at the top of the page, only those cats are shown.
- The "Rate these cats!" section to the top-right becomes a drop-down menu.
- The radio buttons are hidden, but there's still some visual feedback to show which rating has been selected.

**Note:** All you need to change in `index.html` are these attributes on various elements:

```
href=""
id=""
for=""
```

## CSS selectors that will be useful

```
:target
:checked
element1 + element2
```
