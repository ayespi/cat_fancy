# Cat Fancy

Adam made this website to show off his favorite cat photos. It's a pretty great website, but it could be *even better*.

The HTML and the bulk of the CSS has been provided for you. Your task is to change **only EDIT_ME.css** so that:

- When clicking on one of the CATegories at the top of the page, only those cats are shown.
- The "Rate these cats!" section to the top-right becomes a drop-down menu.
- The radio buttons are hidden, but there's still some visual feedback to show which rating has been selected.

## Things that will be useful

```
:target
